## tool usage
<b>TypeScript</b> was used because aids JAvaScript by providing type safety and allowing me to spot errors early.

<b>React</b> is a library that provides a reliable way of creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) with interactive user interfaces.

<b>Next.js</b> is a comprehensive framework that streamlines application development. This was my first project working with Next, and it made the creation of this app much easier than it otherwise would have been.

<b>Docusaurus</b> is an open-source static site generator (SSG) that streamlines the creation of documentation websites.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. Next.js: This was my fist time working with Next.js, and it was a slight challenge, but luckily, it was intuitive and easy to pick up. One tutorial video was enough for me to begin working with it on my own.
2. Docusaurus: This is also my fist time working with Docusaurus, and it's a lot to take in, but the website proves a lot of information that's been incredibly helpful.
