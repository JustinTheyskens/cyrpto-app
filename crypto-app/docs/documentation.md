# Documentation

## Intro
This is a quick and easy <b>Crypto Price Tracker App.</b> It's created using JavaScript and  TypeScript, while leveraging React and Next.js.
This app displays the top 10 Crypto Prices on the market in real-time by utilizing the external API, CoinCap.io.

## Tools used

JavaScript

TypeScript

React

Next.js

## Reasoning for tool usage
<b>TypeScript</b> was used because aids JAvaScript by providing type safety and allowing me to spot errors early.

<b>React</b> is a library that provides a reliable way of creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) with interactive user interfaces.

<b>Next.js</b> is a comprehensive framework that streamlines application development. This was my first project working with Next, and it made the creation of this app much easier than it otherwise would have been.

## Getting Started
Use your terminal to navigate to the directory you've downloaded this project to
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You'll be able to view the top 10 Cryptocurrencies at the time of fetching.
You can refresh the Page to update your results.
You can use the search bar to filter your results.

You can use:
```bash
npm build
# then
npm start
```
for the production build of the app.
